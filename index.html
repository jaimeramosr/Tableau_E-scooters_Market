    <h1>üìä Market Dashboard with Tableau</h1>

    <p>
        This project focuses on preparing and cleaning e-scooter market data using Excel, followed by the development of an executive-oriented dashboard in Tableau. The dashboard highlights key business insights and usage patterns.

    <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Data Preparation with Excel</h2>

    <i>1. Importing Data</i><br>
    <p>
        The original dataset (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/razamh/e-scooters-trips-analysis/input" target="_blank">available on Kaggle</a>) was examined in Excel to understand its structure, identify unnecessary columns, and verify data types.
</p>

    <i>2. Data Cleaning</i><br>
    <p>All cleaning steps were performed using Excel. Key steps included:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Removing duplicates</b></li>
        <li><b>Standardizing data</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Date columns were split into separate <i>date</i> and <i>time</i> fields.</li>
                <li>Trip distance and duration were converted into kilometers and minutes (instead of meters and seconds).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Dropping irrelevant columns/rows</b></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The final cleaned dataset cannot be shared due to its large file size.</p>

    <h2>üìà Tableau Dashboard Development</h2>

    <i>1. Importing Cleaned Data</i><br>
    <p>
        Cleaned data was imported into Tableau as .csv/.xlsx. Each column‚Äôs data type was validated, especially dates and times. Since Tableau requires a single field for time representation, a Calculated Field was created:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
STR(DATEPART('hour',[Start Time]))
+ ':' +
RIGHT('00' + STR(DATEPART('minute',[Start Time])),2)
    </code></pre>

    <i>2. Creating New Calculated Fields</i><br>
    <p>
        New Calculated Fields included: <b>Weekday, Average Trips per Day, Average Trips per Weekday, and Percent of Total Rides</b>.
    </p>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <pre><code>
Weekday = DATENAME('weekday', [Start Date])
Average Trips per Day = COUNT([Trip ID]) / COUNTD(DATE([Start Date]))
    </code></pre>

    <i>3. Dashboard Design</i><br>
    <p>
        The dashboard design followed executive reporting principles:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Focus on key KPIs.</li>
        <li>Assessment of market and usage trends: monthly, weekly, and hourly rides, trip duration, trip distance, and trip origin/destination areas.</li>
        <li>Comparison of market share among service providers.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Visualizations used:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bar charts (monthly, daily, hourly usage)</li>
        <li>Distribution plots (distance and duration of rides)</li>
        <li>Pie charts (market share)</li>
        <li>Tables (origin vs. destination areas)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Interactive filters enhance usability ‚Äî allowing users to adjust by trip duration, distance, provider, weekday, or month.

    <h2>‚úÖ Key Insights</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><b>September</b> shows the highest usage (37% of total), likely influenced by people returning to work/school after summer holidays. In contrast, colder months (November‚ÄìDecember) show lower activity, indicating strong seasonality in scooter demand.</li>
        <li><b>Weekends</b> outperform weekdays due to leisure time. Fleet deployment and battery charging should be maximized during weekends, while maintenance and battery swaps can be performed on weekday nights/mornings.</li>
        <li><b>Peak daily usage</b> occurs from 16:00‚Äì20:00. Scooters should be fully charged and deployed before these hours.</li>
        <li><b>Trip profile:</b> Most rides last < 20 minutes and cover < 5 km ‚Äî confirming scooters are mainly used as last-mile transportation.</li>
        <li><b>Market share:</b> Lime leads over Spin and Bird, holding a competitive advantage.</li>
        <li><b>Geographic usage:</b> Lake View, Lincoln Park, and West Town account for most rides, suggesting these areas require higher fleet allocation.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Additional insights could be extracted if data on trip cost, revenue, profit, long-term trends (multi-year data), or user IDs were available. These would allow for profitability analysis, seasonal forecasting, and customer behavior tracking.
